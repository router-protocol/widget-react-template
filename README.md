There could be use cases where our partners might want to only show a selected list of chains for their users. We have also provided our partners with that capability; capability to restrict chains/tokens to be shown on the widget.

Restriction parameters are optional and can be used with the above customizable parameters as ```query params``` in url-

        Parameter      	 Type	      		Description
	1. srcChains		string		        List of chainId's of source chains seperated by comma that needs to be shown 
                                            in selection menu. Only these chains will be availbale for the users to select

	2. dstChains		string		        List of chainId's of destination chains seperated by comma that needs to be shown                                         in selection menu.

## Wallet

There is two option to connect with wallet.

    1. One you can directly pass true value in useWalletWidget parameter. Then you can directly use the wallet provide by router widget itself.
    
    2. Second you can pass wallet provider in the global Window interface location: RouterWidget/index.tsx. Then you can use own wallet on the router widget.
